## Overview

This is my first front-end challenge from frontendmentor.com. I'm currently learning HTML and CSS and wanted to test what I've learned so far. I started my first challenge, which tasked me with creating a QR card for desktop and mobile devices. An image of the finished product is provided.

## My process

First, I structured the elements using HTML to create a general layout of the card. Next, I created a CSS file and started to edit the styles. When editing the styles, I began by adjusting the QR image and card container. Afterwards, I centered the card container inside the main container. Next, I centered the content inside the card container and added padding. Then, I rounded the edges of the QR image and card container. Finally, I imported the given font and adjusted the font size and color.
